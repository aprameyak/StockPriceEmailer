## Components

- **Node.js Script**: Uses `SESClient` to send an email using AWS Simple Email Service (SES). Fetches stock data via the Yahoo Finance API based on predefined tickers.

- **AWS Lambda Function**: Executes the script using a Node.js runtime (ARM architecture) and includes a Lambda layer for dependencies. It assumes an execution role with permission to access AWS SES.

- **AWS IAM Policy**: Follows the principle of least privilege and is attached to the Lambda execution role to allow access to AWS SES.

- **AWS SES**: Handles verified email sending and receiving. Sends the stock data to a personal email from a registered sender address.

- **AWS EventBridge Schedule**: Triggers the Lambda function every 24 hours to fetch and email stock prices on a recurring basis.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Yahoo Finance API  
- **Cloud Services**: AWS Lambda, AWS IAM, AWS SES, AWS EventBridge
