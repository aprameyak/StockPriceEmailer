# StockPriceEmailer
I created a script to send me daily emails of given stocks as specified. This was done with a Node.js script written for AWS Lambda using a layer for the node package dependencies. This script used a public API to fetch stock data on the given API. The Lambda function was given an execution role as specified with AWS IAM. The IAM policy gave the function access to a verified proxy email to send to my personal email using AWS SES. An AWS Eventbridge scheduler was used to invoke the Lambda function daily to make the process autonomous. I am able to get daily updates on stock data to my inbox based on the tickers that I have chosen. By customizing the script, I can expand it to even more tickers or change the scheduler to send more frequent updates on stock data.
